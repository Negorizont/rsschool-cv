## Code example

```
info.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
  let target = event.target;
  if (target && target.classList.contains('info-header-tab')) {
    for(let i = 0; i < tab.length; i++) {
      if (target == tab[i]) {
        hideTabContent(0);
        showTabContent(i);
        break;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Experience

I recently completed an assignment for admission to an internship. I didn't pass after the second round where it was necessary to correct mistakes. In my opinion the task was solved well, as it was necessary to work with forms, and I at that time had no experience with them. There are things to work on to improve the work. You can see the work on the [link](https://github.com/Negorizont/Mercury-task.git).
